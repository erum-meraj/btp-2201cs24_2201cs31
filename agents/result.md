Obtain detailed task DAGs, including computational requirements, data sizes, and dependencies for each task. Acquire energy consumption profiles and monetary cost models for all available nodes and network transfers.\\n\\nStep 2: Model Task Performance, Energy, and Cost for All Placement Options.\\n    For each individual task, estimate its execution time, energy consumption, and monetary cost if placed on an edge node versus a cloud node. Calculate data transfer times, energy, and cost for inter-task communication, especially considering network latency and bandwidth between dependent tasks placed on different nodes (edge-edge, edge-cloud, cloud-cloud).\\n\\nStep 3: Formulate Multi-Objective Optimization Problem.\\n    Define the objective function, typically a weighted sum of total system latency, total energy consumption, and total monetary cost across all tasks. Establish constraints, including respecting task dependencies, ensuring node resource capacities are not exceeded, and meeting any service level objectives (SLOs).\\n\\nStep 4: Generate and Evaluate Candidate Task Placement Strategies.\\n    Propose a set of potential task placement configurations (e.g., all edge, all cloud, various hybrid splits considering dependencies). For each candidate strategy, use the models from Step 2 to compute the overall system utility (total latency, energy, cost) according to the objective function defined in Step 3. This step involves calling an internal or external `EvaluatorAgent`.\\n\\nStep 5: Select Optimal Placement and Update Policy.\\n    Compare the evaluated candidate strategies and identify the task placement configuration that yields the best utility score. If this optimal strategy significantly improves upon the current active policy, update the system's task offloading policy accordingly.\\n\\nStep 6: Communicate Refined Task Placement Plan.\\n    Send the chosen optimal task placement strategy to the `ExecutorAgent` for implementation or to an `OutputAgent` for reporting and visualization.\",\n  \"evaluation_summary\": {\n    \"overall_assessment\": \"The provided plan outlines a comprehensive approach to task offloading, encompassing data collection, modeling, optimization, and deployment.
