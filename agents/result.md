## ü™Ñ Final Output (Structured JSON)
```json
"```json\n{\n  \"plan_summary\": \"The provided plan outlines a six-step methodology for evaluating and optimizing task placement in edge-cloud environments. It encompasses gathering system state and task requirements, generating candidate placement strategies, evaluating these strategies against tradeoffs (latency, energy, cost), optimizing the selection, formulating an actionable plan, and continuously monitoring for adaptation. The plan emphasizes the use of real-time metrics, task dependencies (DAG), and multi-objective optimization.\",\n  \"evaluation_summary\": \"The plan is comprehensive and well-structured, covering all critical aspects of task placement optimization. The `utility_evaluator` tool is identified as a key component, fitting perfectly within 'Step 3: Evaluate Candidate Strategies Against Tradeoffs'. It would be used to quantify the performance (latency, energy, cost) of each proposed placement strategy. A hypothetical demonstration showcased how `utility_evaluator` would be called with `workflow_data`, `placement`, and `params` for a single task 'T1' on a hypothetical edge node, illustrating its role in calculating metrics based on task requirements and node characteristics.\",\n  \"recommended_policy\": \"The `utility_evaluator` tool should be integrated into 'Step 3: Evaluate Candidate Strategies Against Tradeoffs' of the proposed plan. For each candidate task placement strategy generated in Step 2, the `utility_evaluator` should be invoked to calculate the estimated end-to-end latency, total energy consumption, and total monetary cost. The outputs from the `utility_evaluator` will then feed into the optimization algorithm in Step 4 to select the best placement strategy based on defined objectives and constraints.\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\"\n}\n```"
